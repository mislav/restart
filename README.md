# The Restart.Network workshop

The story of the city, the bombardment and reconstruction, and the drive to innovate that locals still use today to shape their city all make Rotterdam a fascinating place to visit. Everything seems possible here, and there's so much left to explore.

Is Rotterdam a must-see city? Absolutely!


# Rich cultural scene

Rotterdam has a rich cultural scene centred largely around the cultural axis between Museumpark and Witte de Withstraat. The area includes acclaimed museums like Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, The New Institute and the Kunsthal, presenting a widely varied range of art exhibitions.

TENT and Witte de With guarantee a relevant, innovative, experimental programme, and the numerous galleries around Witte de Withstraat and outside the city centre are also well worth your time.
